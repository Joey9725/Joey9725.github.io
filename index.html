    <p>Hello, my name is Joe, this is my webpage and I built it myself. I am a 17 year old high school student and when I discovered that I could put something on the internet for free through <a href="http://www.github.com">Github</a> I jumped all over it and created this site telling you about me. I started to learn code when I was in 8th grade right after I discovered computers, I started by using <a href="http://www.codecademy.com">Codecademy</a> I learned most of what it could offer at the time. Now that I have this site I can see what I would need to know to be a web developer. Oh by the way if you don't type the code yourself you are a noob, but it's okay.</p>
